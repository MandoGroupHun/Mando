# Application setup history

* Create template application with `dotnet new angular -o MandoWebApp -au Individual -uld` while having dotnet 6.0 cli installed
* Prepare for code scaffolding by installing nuget package `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.CodeGeneration.Design@6.0.2`
    * This package is not compatible with dotnet 6.0.3, so downgrade everything to `6.0.2`
* Scaffold Identity so we can make changes to Registration flow based on [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/scaffold-identity?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio#scaffold-identity-into-an-mvc-project-with-authorization)
* Run `npm install` from an elevated commadn prompt from inside the `MandoWebApp/ClientApp` (this may be done automatically if you run VS as administrator ðŸ¤”)
* Start application

## CI/CD

Every contributions to main branch will trigger a new build and deployment to production, as described in `.github/workflows/cd-cd.yml` file.

## Production stack

The production stack is described in `docker-compose.yml` file. Run it simply with the below command in `./MandoWebApp` directory.
```
docker-compose up
```
Press `Ctrl+C` to stop it.

### Secret management

Add build time secrets [here](https://github.com/MandoGroupHun/Mando/settings/secrets/actions/new).
Reference them in `ci-cd.yml` as needed:
```
with:
    username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}
```

Add runtime secrets [here](https://github.com/MandoGroupHun/Mando/settings/environments/476737565/edit).
Make them available for the environment in `ci-cd.yml` like
```
env:
    DB_APP_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.DB_APP_PASSWORD }}
```
Reference runtime secrets in `docker-compose.yml` to make them available for the app
```
environment:
    - Db__Password=${DB_APP_PASSWORD}
```

## MariaDB setup

* Download [MariaDB Server 10.6.](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&p=mariadb&r=10.6.7) (That's the latest version supported by [Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql](https://github.com/PomeloFoundation/Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql#supported-database-servers-and-versions))
* [Install it](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/installing-mariadb-msi-packages-on-windows/) with a passwordless root user.
* Start the DB. (On default installation, the Windows service starts automatically.)
* Apply migrations with `Update-Database` or `dotnet ef database update`
* Connect to the DB with HeidiSQL - it's installed by default with MariaDB Server.
